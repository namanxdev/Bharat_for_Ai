Team Name : Crusaders
Problem Statement : Build an AI-powered solution that improves access to information, resources, or
opportunities for communities and public systems.
Brief about the Idea:
Millions of citizens struggle to access government welfare
schemes due to:
Lack of awareness
Complex eligibility rules
Language and literacy barriers
Difficult online application portals
Our solution is an AI-powered assistant platform that helps
citizens:
Discover relevant schemes
Check eligibility instantly
Get guided support in local languages
Apply through secure autofill + agent-assisted submission
This reduces friction between citizens and public service
systems.
Existing government portals are static and hard to navigate.
Most solutions only provide information, not application support.
Our platform is AI-driven, personalized, and multilingual.
Unlike generic chatbots, it includes eligibility checking + autofill workflows.
Adds an agent verification layer to ensure trust, consent, and real submission
support.
Designed specifically for rural, low-literacy, and PWD users with voice-first
access.
Multilingual + Voice-First AI Assistant for inclusive access
Personalized Scheme Recommendation based on user profile
Secure Autofill Application Drafts for faster applications
Agent Verification + Consent Layer prevents misuse and
ensures trust
End-to-End Support from scheme discovery → eligibility →
submission → tracking
Built for real-world deployment via WhatsApp and low
bandwidth channels
Citizens often miss schemes due to lack of awareness and complexity.
The AI chatbot helps users discover relevant schemes instantly.
Eligibility engine reduces confusion by showing only applicable schemes.
Autofill system removes repetitive manual form filling and reduces errors.
Agent-assisted workflow enables completion even when govt portals require OTP/CAPTCHA.
Notifications and tracking ensure users stay informed after applying.
List of features offered by the solution
It is always better to add a few visual representations (drawings/sketches/illustrations etc.) to your
presentation, it adds to the power through which it reaches the audience.
AI Chatbot for Scheme Discovery
Users ask questions in local language and get accurate scheme guidance.
Eligibility Check & Recommendation Engine
Matches schemes based on user profile (age, income, category, location).
User Profile Database (One-Time Data Entry)
Citizens provide details once; reused for multiple applications.
Autofill Application Draft Generator
Forms are pre-filled automatically to reduce effort and errors.
Agent-Assisted Submission Layer
Agents confirm documents, OTP, and final submission for security.
Accessibility Support
Voice interface, low-bandwidth access, PWD-friendly design.

User Flow
1.Citizen interacts with chatbot
(voice/text/WhatsApp)
2.AI understands request and detects
intent
3.System retrieves schemes from
database
4.Eligibility is checked instantly
5.User selects a scheme to apply
6.Form is auto-filled using stored profile
7.Agent verifies documents + user consent
8.Application is submitted and tracked

Architecture diagram of the proposed solution
1. User Access Layer
Citizens access the platform via Mobile App / Web / WhatsApp / Voice.
Supports rural and low-literacy users.
Example: User asks: “Which scholarship can I apply for?”
2. AI Interaction Layer
Speech-to-Text (ASR): Converts voice queries into text.
Multilingual Chatbot: Provides scheme guidance in local languages.
NLP Intent Detection: Extracts intent + key details (age, state, category).
Example: Query: “Old age pension in MP” → Intent: Pension Scheme Lookup, Entity:
State = MP
3. Data & Knowledge Layer
Scheme Database: Stores govt schemes, eligibility rules, and required documents.
User Profile Database: Stores citizen details securely (with consent).
Vector Search Engine: Retrieves the most relevant schemes using semantic search.
Example:  “Help for poor students” → Scholarship schemes retrieved.
4. Application Assistance Layer
Eligibility Engine: Checks scheme eligibility using rules + AI.
Autofill Form Generator: Prefills forms using saved user profile data.
Agent Verification Dashboard: Agent confirms documents + OTP consent.
Example: User details auto-mapped into application form fields.
5. Submission & Notification Layer
Assisted submission on the govt portal (manual due to CAPTCHA/OTP).
User receives SMS/WhatsApp confirmation + tracking updates.
6. Security & Monitoring Layer
Data is protected using encryption, IAM access control, and audit logs.
Analytics track scheme usage and impact.
Technologies to be used in the solution:
AI Components
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Multilingual NLP + Intent Detection
Speech Recognition (Voice-first access)
Backend
FastAPI
PostgreSQL for structured scheme + user data
Vector Database for semantic search
Frontend
React
WhatsApp Bot integration for rural access

To keep costs low:
Use RAG + Retrieval instead of full LLM calls every time
Cache common scheme FAQs
Run OpenSearch only for scheme indexing
Use Lambda for lightweight workloads
Voice services only when required
Store only essential citizen data (minimizes storage + compliance)
Monitoring + Security
$50–100
